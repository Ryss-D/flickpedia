The current project represents a quick sketch using a combination of bloc and clean architecture to structure de whole project. 
The main state manager is BloC as well.
The main data source is the https://www.themoviedb.org/ API
The documentation was generated using built-in dartdoc funcionality (With the respective comments into the code)
Some remarcable libraries used during the development are: 
  - getIt => Dependency injection
  - flutter_bloc => Easier state managemente
  - equatable => Object comparition
  - intl => Taking advantage of built-in internazionalization
  - flutter_dotenv => Secrects Management
  - Mockito => Complement testing
  - draggable_home & flutter_rating_bar => Save development time

Some  next steps  maybe implement some CI/CD automation as well as polish some animations.
